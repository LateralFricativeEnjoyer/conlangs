# Frísú [ˈfri15.su15]

## Description
Frísú, the language of the seafaring Clan Frísú, is a flowing, beautiful language. It is a tonal, mostly head-final language with a number of local and nonlocal case suffixes. Sharing many features with J'ẹr, Djei, and Îär-Tôr, it is written in the Roívikú syllabary, left to right.

## Phonology and Phonetics    
Frísú lacks nasal consonants, instead opting for a beautiful variety of fricatives and laterals, producing a sound rich in long rising vowels and geminates. 
The chart below shows the consonants and vowels of Frísú. However, some rules apply:
 * Word-final ⟨a⟩ is pronounced \[ə\].
 * Vowels are lengthened when followed by another vowel or a voiced consonant (this does not apply to the schwa as seen above, even in compound words).
 * ⟨l⟩ is pronounced \[l̪\] when followed by an dental sound, and \[l\] otherwise
 * Syllable-initial plosives are aspirated.
 * The acute accent ( ´ ) marks a rising (15 or ˩ ˥) tone. The falling tone was used in old Frísú, but was replaced with irregularly placed long vowels in middle Frísú, which were themselves removed by modern Frísú.
 * Word-final fricatives (including the lateral fricative \[ɬ\]) are slightly geminated. When a sequence of two fricatives ends a word (rarely seen, but present in the word *roítalasf*  \[ˌɹ̈ɔːi15.ˈt̪ʰeː.lesfːː\] ‘like a call (of a horn or siren)’), it is heavily geminated.
 * Word-initial ⟨r⟩ is usually pronounced as a bunched or molar \[ɹ̈\] or a retroflex \[ɻ\]. Old Frísú (which had the alveolar nasal \[n\]) realized the clusters ⟨rt⟩, ⟨rd⟩, ⟨rn⟩, ⟨rlh⟩, and ⟨rl⟩ as \[ɻʈ\], \[ɻɖ\], \[ɻɳ\], \[ɻꞎ\] and \[ɻɭ\] respectively in a word-initial position, but considering that these clusters are mostly not present in the modern language, they are no considered correct. Correct pronunciation of rlesídú ‘design etched or embedded in the ground’ is still disputed (if the ⟨l⟩ is retroflexed or not).

## Stress patterns

## Word format
Frísú uses the VOS word order for statements and normally intoned sentences. Commands and questions are written in the VSO word order. A distinguishing word, which also serves as a marker for the subject and object, is inserted. In VOS order, the word is o (from ao ‘on’), and is placed between the object and subject. In VSO order, the word is tí (from tio ‘there’), and is placed in the same location. In modern formal Frísú, the suffix -íth is used on the verb in VOS order (with the rising tone removed from the previous vowel). Also in the modern formal language, with VSO order, the nominative and accusative forms are used for nouns (this used to apply to all word orders, but was eliminated for simplicity.) To transform nouns, change the second vowel in the word (first in a one-vowel word) according to the chart below.

## Articles
Frísú uses the definite article fí (derivation unknown, possibly from the archaic verb prefix ví-, meaning ‘more is known about this action’) and the indefinite article eú (derived from old Frísú reú ‘one’). Frísú also has the negative article (as a prefix) ak- (from ak kú, meaning ‘(this is) without’) and, used in technical or intentionally specific language, the semidefinite article feú, a combination of fí and eú, used to represent a case that is possibly (but not certainly) co-occurrence. For example, if (some) raindrop(s) complete the actions ‘fly through the air’ and ‘land on their head’ they could (but are not necessarily) be the same, so the semidefinite feú is used on the second occurrence of telkú ‘raindrop’. If they are known to be the same, the definite would be used, and if they were known to be different raindrops (as in (some) raindrop(s) that ‘land on my head’ and also ‘land on their head’), the indefinite would be used. A translation to demonstrate this would be as follows (with the articles and article prefixes (described below) in bold):

*Rovzilavíth vealh liotúrl o eú telkú. Erovzilavíth uralh liotúrl o eú telkú.* ‘A raindrop landed on my head. A raindrop landed on their head.’ (Indefinite article, as one raindrop cannot land on two heads.)

*Rovfelhtoríth fí selithík o eú telkú. Erolhazilavíth vealh liotúrl o feú telkú.* ‘A raindrop flew through the air. A (semidefinite) raindrop landed on my head.’ (Semidefinite article, as the two raindrops mentioned are possibly the same.)   

## Noun Case
As mentioned earlier, Frísú has a number of local and nonlocal cases, most as suffixes. The nominative and accusative cases, described in ‘Word Format’ are, for the most part, the only exception to this rule. The other cases are presented below:
 * Genitive (marked on possessor) uses the suffix -ge
 * Instrumental ( also applies to ‘guided by’ or prolative case) uses the suffix *-(e)lh*
 * Comitative uses the suffix *-o*
 * Benefactive uses the suffix *-(i)k*. This is a modern shortening of ike ‘for’, and prevents the (incorrect) use of the comitative for this purpose.
 * Vocative (not always used) sometimes uses a reduplicating last syllable, often with minor changes:
    * *Terivírú* + Vocative = *Terivírúru*
    * *Lar* + Vocative = *Larer*
    * *Dovú* + Vocative = *Dovúvú*

Local cases:
 * A basic locative case uses the suffix *-g*
 * Adessive uses the suffix *-(a)rl*
 * Ablative uses the suffix *-ralh*
 * Lative uses the suffix *-lalh*
 * Perlative uses the suffix *-thík*

## Verb Tense, Modality, Aspect, and Agreement
Verbs in Frísú use three base tenses, all of which have fairly regular forms. The prefix r(o)- denotes past tense, g(o)- present tense, and z(o)- future tense. Another prefix, dzí- (a rare use of an affricate in Frísú) denotes an altered or exaggerated form of the tense marker it precedes. For example a prefix of dzír(o)- would mean ‘far past’ and dzíz(o)- ‘far future’. Dzíg(o)-, up until middle Frísú, was used as a narrative or imaginary tense, but is now usually replaced by the simpler past tense.
Sometimes used to indicate causation, a set of relative tense prefixes, e- and a-, precede the other tense prefix(es), and indicate, for e-, an event that takes place after or caused by the previous, and, for a-, an event that takes place before or causes an event. These are similar in use to English auxiliaries such as because, then, and before. Because of this ability, relative tense (where both actions are in the past tense but one comes after the other) is not always encoded with first-things-first syntax in Frísú. Their use is demonstrated below, with the prefixes and their meanings in bold.

* *Rotsíelkú relú. Aroígelar delarú.* ‘I cried. Because they (singular) failed earlier.’
* *Zoevtelí fí therúlírú relú. Ezofalhe delarú.* ‘I will enter the cave. Then they (singular) will follow.’

Verbs also agree in definiteness (of both the subject and any object present, similar to a polypersonal language) using a prefix that comes after the tense prefix(es). They are as follows:
    
Because of the highly detailed prefixes, the articles are usually dropped from speech (except in highly formal settings (and even there, speaking the articles is becoming archaic)). However, removing the articles in writing is considered improper.
Modality is indicated by a set of postverbal modal auxiliaries, with fairly standardly created forms. They consist of the applicable verb’s agreement prefix from the table above, which is not indicated on the verb but instead is moved to the auxiliary, and a suffix, seen on the table below
	
## Adjectives

## Compound words
Compound words are formed by changing the voicedness of the last letter of the first word or the first letter of the second word to have opposite voicedness from each other. The word with more back vowels is prioritized for the change:

 * *Elík* \[ɛː.ˈli15k\] ‘cold’ + *salhú* \[ˈseɬ.u15\] ‘glass’ = *elíkzalhú* \[ɛː.ˌli15k.zeɬ.ˈu15\] ‘ice’
 * *Úrolít* \[u15rɔː.ˈli15t̪\] ‘quiet’ + *ferú* \[ˈfɛː.ru\] ‘disgust’ = *úrolídferú* \[u15rɔː.ˈli15d̪.ˌfɛː.ru\] ‘contempt’

## Writing

## Evolution

The evolution of the Frísú language can be classified into five main stages (with their names at the time in quotes), and three dialects:
Uğhandü (the mother of a family (the Uğh family) with many languages, including Dwańni (also spelled Duańi), Maërnu, Dhyrümn, and Frísú. Khơlīvh Ɯr is sometimes considered a member of this family, though it does not directly descend from Uğhandü (It is closer to a ʔlit'ûl language))
* Proto Frísú ‘Vìʒuún’
* Old Frísú ‘Vrìzü Laà’
* Middle Frísú ‘Frīsúlā’
* Modern Frísú ‘Frísú’
* Oúnaiilú, a form of Frísú used in naval communication (which notably has 29 separate words describing the state of water, from stormy seas to a foggy calm)
* Ténovú, a version of Frísú spoken by various other Clans (commonly studied by Frísú scholars as an example of language evolution) 
* Ğhem, a now-extinct ritual language descendent of Frísú, which incorporated elements of Dwańni, as well as including the phonemes \[h\], \[n\], \[m\], \[x\], \[b\], and \[ɣ\].
