title: Help&#58; Langcodes
---

**Langcodes** are a system invented by me to indicate various languages in my constructed world. Here's an example:

As you can see, a langcode has 3 parts. The first, a period, is a *relative* marker of a language's history. Below are some periods:

 * Modern Period: m-
 * Middle Period: d-
 * Classical Period: c-
 * Archaic Period: a-
 * Old Period: o-
 * Protolanguage Period: p-

Again, these prefixes are relative. The English language might have periods looking like this (I've reserved ENG as an identifier for English because of translator purposes):

 * pGER: Proto-West-Germanic (4th-5th centuries)
 * oENG: Anglo-Saxon (7th-10th centuries)
 * aENG: Nonexistent, because we don't need it!
 * cENG: Anglo-Saxon, after Norman invasion (11th-13th centuries)
 * dENG: Later Middle English (14th-16th centuries)
 * mENG: [Modern English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuN6gs0AJls) (16th-21st centuries)
