The IPA ([International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)) is the system of phonetic and phonemic representation used throughout this website. The IPA is fairly standardized, however, a chart is provided below to clear up confusion and easily reference how I write IPA. 

IPA here is written [between square brackets] when it describes an *exact or close phonetic representation* of a sound or sounds, such as describing how to pronounce a word or showig the intricacies of phonetic systems in a language.

IPA will be written /between forward slashes/ when it describes a *loose or open phonemic representation* of a sound or sounds, such as giving a looser pronunciation key for strange orthographies or indicating a *relative difference* in sounds while not perfectly describing them.
