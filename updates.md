title: U̇vįolıhu Writing System Progress!
---

10/17/2022

I've been working a little on the writing system for the language U̇vįolıhu! It's an abugida.

 * Added the letters ɸ and x to make it a bit more alien looking
 * Added boundary-sensitive s
 
 The lang isn't done yet, but it can only have CV and VC syllables, with a max C cluster length of 2 (CCV is also allowed)
 It's aspiration sensitive now! Suffixed -h
