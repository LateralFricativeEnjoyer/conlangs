## Description
Gylhevř, the ʔlat’ûl language of the desert-dwelling Clan Gylhev, is a blunt, deep language, composed of doubly articulated consonants, opposite rounding vowels, and nasal clusters. It has a long verb affix process, creating almost-agglutinated words closely resembling Djei, Q̈oþpor, and Cəkpiŋ. It is written in the Gzokangbyř alphabet, in a left-to-right boustrophedon.
