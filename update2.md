There's a trend, among conlangers, to create out-of-world uses for their langs and worldbuilding. 
Maybe you're making a world of elves and dragons, but, for practice, you translate some memes into Elvish.

Here's a Djei menu (adpted from the in-world street food stand JÌƒanit'amqi) with a modern twist: what if they lived today as a real culture, 
with our writing system, monetary system, and language?

It's got:
 * All the classic dishes
 * Correct, calculated prices
 * Traditional format and options
 * Original Djei language names
 * A disclaimer at the bottom (a pun on those "Consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, or eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness." ones)
